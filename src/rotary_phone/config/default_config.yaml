# Default configuration for Rotary Phone VoIP Controller
# User config (config.yaml) will override these values

# SIP/VoIP Settings
sip:
  server: ""                    # VoIP.ms server (e.g., seattle.voip.ms)
  username: ""                  # VoIP.ms account or sub-account

# Speed Dial Mappings
# Short codes that map to full phone numbers
# Example: "11": "+12065551234"  # Dad's cell
speed_dial: {}

# Whitelist - numbers that can be dialed directly
# Use [] to block all direct dialing (speed dial only)
# Use ["*"] to allow any number
# Example: ["+12065551234", "+12065555678", "911"]
whitelist: []

# Hardware GPIO Pin Assignments (BCM numbering)
hardware:
  pin_hook: 17              # Hook switch (HIGH = on-hook, LOW = off-hook)

  pin_dial_active: 22       # Dial off-normal (optional, 0 to disable)
  pin_ringer: 23            # Ringer amplifier enable
  pin_low_battery: 24       # PowerBoost LBO pin (optional, 0 to disable)

# Timing Constants (in seconds)
timing:
  debounce_time: 0.01           # GPIO debounce time (10ms)
